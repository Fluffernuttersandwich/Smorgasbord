# 🧟 Wasteland Profile (MO2) — Experimental

I’ve added a **Wasteland Profile** inside of MO2 for Smörgåsbord.

I originally created this just to try it myself, but since I was already doing the work, I figured I’d share it with anyone who’s interested.  
If you like this, let me know.

## What Is Wasteland?

If you haven’t played it before, **Wasteland** is a major overhaul mod designed to make *7 Days to Die* feel more like **Fallout**.  
It makes **significant changes to core game systems**, progression, and the overall gameplay loop.

### What to Expect

- You begin with a **blacked-out screen**
- You must spend **21 attribute points** before you can begin a new game
- After that, gameplay proceeds with familiar early-game 7DtD challenges
- The overhaul introduces a **completely different perk progression system**

This is not a small tweak — it meaningfully alters how the game works.

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

Please read these carefully before using the Wasteland profile.

### Warning #1 — Support Expectations

> **Do NOT ask bdubyah or the Wasteland Discord for help** with issues related to:
- Running Wasteland inside MO2  
- Running Wasteland inside Smörgåsbord  
- Any hybrid setup involving this profile  

Their expected response will be:
- Remove all other mods  
- Start a brand new game  
- Or troubleshoot it yourself  

That’s fair on their end. This setup is outside their intended support scope.

### Warning #2 — Experimental Profile

This Wasteland profile is **experimental**.

That said:
- I have personally playtested the delivered profile  
- No errors appeared  
- No concerning warnings appeared  
- Several hours of gameplay were stable  

Still, this is provided **as-is**.

### Warning #3 — This Profile Is Fragile

This is the most important section.

The normal Smörgåsbord profile can tolerate a lot of mod toggling during a new game.  
**The Wasteland profile cannot.**

> Consider this MO2 profile to be **extremely fragile**.

#### Safe:
- You can **disable** mods you don’t want, and the profile will usually continue to function.

#### Unsafe:
- Enabling additional mods is very likely to break things.
- Mods touching any of the following are especially risky:
  - UI  
  - Progression  
  - Recipes  
  - Traders  
  - Loot  
  - Armor  
  - Weapons  

> Enabling even a single incompatible mod can introduce errors.

## ❌ No Patch Support

To be very clear:

- We will **not** be making compatibility patches  
- We will **not** be troubleshooting custom combinations  
- This is provided on a **take it or leave it** basis  

If you enjoy experimenting and understand the risks — great.  
If not, you should probably stick with the standard Smörgåsbord profile.

---

## Final Notes

This exists for players who:
- Want to experience Wasteland  
- Prefer using MO2  
- Understand experimental setups  
- Are comfortable self-troubleshooting  

If that’s you — have fun.  
If not — totally fair, skip this profile.
