## Mod Notes

---

"My game is still too dark?!"

Experiment with other Lighting mods in the pack, or disable all of them and play with vanilla Lighting.

Adjust your Brightness settings.

Default recommendations:

"Better Lighting - Gentle Contrast Edition" enabled as your Lighting mod under the Graphics Separator.

Also enable "Add-on to Better Lighting - Night Vision Goggles Booster".  It's great!

**Set in-game Brightness to 0%.**

This is how this game is meant to be played!

**Vehicle Cruise Control**: When mounted in/on a vehicle, cycle the Q-key on the keyboard to switch from Slow, Sprint, and Off.

---

**OCB's Parachute**: You need the Parachute item mod installed on your chest armor, and a single use parachute item in your tool belt for it to work.  
When falling from a great height, cycle to the parachute item in the toolbelt, and use it with the item use button.  
You will have limited control of the parachute, and still might take a minimal amount of falling damage.  
It's a test mod, not 100% perfect, but it's super fun!

**Key Binds for EFT/EFT Extraction Pack:**

How do I change firing type? From Full-Auto to Single-Fire or Burst?  Z-key

How do I switch to under-barrel launchers?  X-key

How do I switch ammo types from vanilla to EFT ammo on EFT guns?  Hold the R-key, use the wheel to select the ammo choice.  


There is an Add-on mod to the EFT Extraction Pack called "ZEFT_Extraction_No_Vanilla_Guns".  


This mod removes vanilla pipe guns from loot and traders, but you should still be able to craft them.  


It also makes it so the Trader rewards you with an EFT gun when you complete the initial Buried Supplies mission.

**Izayo's All in One Weapons Pack (Izy AIO)**

Some Tier 3 and all Tier 4 Weapons require the Advanced Weapons Repair Kit.
If a weapon has a gold star on the icon, it needs an Advanced Weapons Repair Kit to repair it. Search your crafting menu for the recipe for how to make it... requires a Legendary Part.

If you want to change the shape variation of the red-dot sight, hold the reflex sight in hand and press the right or left mouse button.

No, within the game you will not see pictures in a picture, this image is just a representation.  


How am I supposed to actually use the minigun?!
Take steroids first, then use minigun.  You can only fire the minigun in first-person while juiced on 'roids. 


Notice 10: How do I use the flashlight and kick?
When holding an Izy Weapon, you press the F-key to kick.
If you want to toggle the flashlight on/off, you can crouch, then press the F-key.
Or, you can swap to an non-izy item in your tool belt, and press the F-key.

Ragsy's **Vehicle Madness** 

You must have this mod enabled when you start a new save.

It adds repairable wrecked vehicles throughout the world.

Please see this page for details on how the mod works:

What about the **CompoPack**?


These are very challenging POIs! 


The aesthetics are a mixed bag.


This mod is a "historical preservation society" for every community made POI ever made over the years. 


If you don't like it, that's fine, but please don't complain about it.  Just play without these mods.

How do I use **Custom Avatars (VRoid)?**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not use Witos Camera with VRoid. 


VRoid replaces your standard character with a new Avatar.  
There are three anime characters to choose from by default.  
I will continue to add Avatars as they are added.


Currently. the older Avatars do not have all of their hand motions mapped to 2.x!  
I would recommend waiting until Avatars are updated to 2.x.
I will add updated Avatars for you in future updates to Smorgasbord.  


To use/change VRoid Avatars, in-game, open the Character tab, press the golden hexagon icon. Select the Avatar of your choice. 
It might look like the VRoid Avatar is overlayed on top of a normal 7DtD character, but that will clear up when you back out of the menu.  
You might see a stutter, or even a Null Error warning, but it will go away.

I will add Avatars and new Dances to Smorgasbord as they come online for 2.x.  

If you want to add the old ones, you must add those Avatar files (from individual mods) manually to the Avatars folder under VRoid in MO2's folder directory.

Dance files need to be manually dragged into the Dances folder under the main VRoid Mod manually yourself! 

Do _**not**_ add too many dances, either you won't be able to see some of them within the radial Dance (Tab) menu, or none of them will display at all.  

Pick a handful at a time to test what you like.  

They are very cute.

If you have a problem with aiming, Aim Down Scope (ADS), go into this mod's menu golden hexagon and uncheck "Aim Correction".

I will not be adding NSFW skins, you can do that yourself, no judgement, I just can't do that at Guppy's.


Note: Using Izy + Custom Avatar (VRoid) will still do a funny thing with the hands changing from 3rd person view to FPV when you ADS.  
Your Custom Avatar hands will be temporarily be replaced with the Izy hands when you ADS when using Custom Avatar (VRoid).  
This is because Izy does his hands differently than vanilla or EFT-O/X.  
Izy currently does not have plans to update his hands.    


**How do I make them Gesture and Dance?**

Hold the Tab key on your keyboard.
Move the cursor to either the Gesture or Dance balloon.
This will open up either Gesture or Dance Option screen.  
Move the cursor to the Gesture or Dance of your choice.  
Enjoy the Gesture/Dance.
You can also cancel the gesture/dance with the Escape key.

## Mods to consider avoiding while using this ModList:

A. **Firearms Expansion 5 (FE5)** , **Pant's Weapons**

Ammo Conflicts, progression.xml issues, and mod compatibility errors.

---

B. IDC Core and Nomad mod suite.  

I really wish I could get this mod to work since now biome progression is an important part of game version 2.x.  
However, there are multiple compatibility issues with other mods on the ModList.  

The Nomad doesn't have full functionality in multiplayer.

IDC Core is boobytrapped to not work with any Storage Broadcasting mods.  

---

C. This Mod List is not compatible with the main EFT Overhaul, Rebirth, Darkness Falls, nor most other Overhauls.  

No, I will not make it compatible, that's too much work.  

---

D. "Brazmocks Archery", and "Falcons Bicycle Changes" are currently messing up the progression.xml code in other mods.  Until those are fixed, I'm leaving them out.  

If one of you guys want to try to figure it out, please help the community if you are able!  

---

E. "Active Ingredients", it was breaking compatibility with other mods in the list and keeping me from loading into a game.  

---

F. "OCB Advanced Pin Recipes"  Conflicts with various UI mods, might work with only using the vanilla UI.  

---

G. "SMX" UI Suite.  I like this UI Suite, but it throws compatibility issues with multiple mods on my Mod List.  
From the author Sirillion himself: SMX does not play nice with added workstation mods, and any mod that adds a progression.xml file.
If one of you guys wants to patch the SMX UI mod, I'd be happy to provide this suite on the list, but right now I have too much on my plate.

---

H. "More Shots" messes with Izy AIO crafting unlock progression.

---

I. "Tank" and "Vehicle Weapon" mods. Errors. 

---

J. "AGF HUD" recent update broke the Perks screen with Smorgasbord.
