## FAQs

**1. Why did you leave the Vortex Collection Nexus Mods Manager system? Why do you hate on Vortex**
   
After a recent Vortex update, it broke the stability of Load Orders.

If you're new to modding, Load Order (mod priority) is sacred!

You can't use an application that regularly messes up established Load Order, because it causes mod conflicts, errors, and crashes.

I care about game stability first and foremost.  

Users kept complaining that the Load Order would randomly rearrange itself between sessions when playing the Vortex Collection.

You need like a damn PHD to understand all of Vortex's quirks.  

It became too time consuming to help users troubleshoot, and I didn't like people bad-mouthing my hard work because the tool was screwing up.  

Vortex is great for Stardew Valley.  Vortex for 7DtD is setting yourself up for failure the longer you use it.

So, it was get the ModList to work in MO2/Wabbajack, or quit providing the list for users entirely.

Thankfully, the Wabbajack community was extremely helpful in getting 7DtD to work in their ecosystem.

**2. "Why didn't you include _fill-in-the-blank-popular-mod_?" and "Why only include mods from Nexus?"**

A. It's my list, I added what I like, feel free to add more, but do so with care so as not to break the ModList.

If you have a good mod suggestion, and have tested it works with the list, please hit me up on the **Guppy's Discord #fns-smörgåsbord channel**. discord.gg/WpVPJWj7Xk

B. Mods from NexusMods are automatically whitelisted for support with Wabbajack/MO2.  It makes for less work, and less hassle for me as a ModList curator.
Including mods from other sources adds more work for me as the curator, and also introduces points of failure for users installing the list.
I'm not looking for more work.
KISS!

**3. Is this for just single player, or could it be multiplayer, or on a dedicated server?**
 
This list is designed for single player and small groups.

There are several users playing multiplayer with friends and family using this ModList.
I regularly host multiplayer games with my sons, brother, and friends using this ModList.  

Community Member Kajdaniec and I have confirmed the list works as a Dedicated Server (but requires all users to download it locally).  

We both had the modList installed and played a test game on his dedicated server.

---

**4. Do both the server and all clients need to download this entire ModList for it to work on multiplayer?**

Yes!  The community-made POIs need to exist on both server and all clients.  

Additionally, some of the mods likely also require installation on both client and server.

I don't keep track of which mods are server side or client side, so don't ask me.  

I don't have experience with dedicated servers, so I am the wrong person to ask to troubleshoot that area.  

A general rule of thumb I learned is this; simple xml mods are generally server side. 

Anything that adds something beyond a Config folder, such as; textures, icons, new items, UI Atlas changes, dll, meshes, animations, new sprites, POI, etc., will need to be on both server and client.  

EAC can stay on for pretty much anything other than when mods start adding in dll files. 
Then EAC has to be off.    
_EAC must be disabled prior to launching this ModList!_

To the Plebbit MidWit itching to correct me: YES, I AM AWARE THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THESE RULES.

**5. No, you should not add this ModList to an existing save/world!  Start a new save/world!**

---
   
**6. No, this ModList is not compatible with other Overhaul ModPacks.**

No, I will not make you a version compatible with Darkness Falls, nor Rebirth, nor any other Overhaul Pack.

Not my circus, not my monkeys.  

Both Khaine and FuriousRamsey do their own thing for their own overhauls.  

Overhaul mods make too many big changes and are not compatible with many mods. 

---

**7. Why don't you use ModLauncher, bundle everything under one zip-file, or make a "real" Overhaul Mod like Darkness Falls and Rebirth?**

A. ModLauncher (ML) won't work for my needs in using so many other authors mods in a collated list like this.  
I tried, it's just not for this use case.  
ML is for "real" pre-bundled Overhaul ModPacks.  

B. This list uses over 300+ mods from about 100+ different Mod Authors.  
I cannot bundle their works into one zip file without each and every mod authors permission... see "herding cats".
People who bundle other authors mods without permission/credit are seen as scum, and generally get banned from nicer modding communities.
I don't want to piss off my fellow mod authors, they're good people!  

C. Khaine and FuriousRamsay have more time and talent to dedicate to their own "real" Overhaul ModPacks than I do.  
They make almost everything themselves in-house for their Overhaul ModPacks, or only use a handful of community-made framework mods.

D. I prefer a more modular approach to modding.  
Darkness Falls and Rebirth are both excellent Overhauls, but contain mods I wish I could disable/add-to. 
With my ModList, it's like a buffet table, take the things you like, and leave the things you don't.

8. **"I don't like the ____ Mod!"**

Disable it, and move on with your life.  No seriously, don't complain, just disable it!

This is the beauty of using MO2; I provide you with a buffet table of options, you get to choose what you want.

Some Mods have requirement mods (see those mod pages for details), but the vast majority of mods in this List are optional!

Caution: If you remove a "big" mod mid-game, you might have to start a new game world/save, or you will have game breaking errors.  

Examples: Don't enable/disable EFT Extraction Pack, Izy, FNS LAtT, and FNS Self-Planting Trees in the middle of a save.  

Good Rule of thumb: A mod with a progression.xml file should not be toggled mid-play.  It will screw you more often than not.    

---

9. **This is not a "lightweight" mod list!**  

If you delete this whole ModList, or disable it in parts, you will 100% need to start a new save/world.

Trying to play a heavily modded save/world in any game, after removing big mods will cause you errors... just start a new world/save! 

---

10. **What about normal Trader Progression for RWG?**
    
On the Generate World settings page, TFPs included a disclaimer that generating a world may break quest progression. 

If you start a new game, and see "NO TRADER" on the top right of your screen, here are your options, pick one:

A. Keep trying a different seed until you get what you want.  

Keep each Biome to at least 14% to have better results of every Biome generating a trader.  

Don't play with maps under 4k in size, or traders might not spawn at all.  

6-10k sized maps are good, 10k+ is best if you want to see more of the Community made POIs. 

B. Walking in to a new Biome will often locate a new Trader for you.  

You could manually find a Trader and complete the first quest missions... 

Since in the base game, the progression starts with a trader, it may work that way on the generated worlds as well.

C. Easiest Method: You could start your world with the creative/debug menus on, find/teleport to your trader of choice, then turn off those menus.  

"How do I use the Creative and Debug Menus?"

In the game world, hit the F1 key to open up the console.  

In the console, type "cm" and hit Enter.  This will turn the Creative Menu on.

Now type "dm" and hit Enter.  This will turn the Debug Menu on.

Hit the Escape key once to back out of the console.

Hit the Escape key again to open up the "Pause/Menu Screen".  

Now you can open up the POI Teleporter.  From the POI Teleporter, you can type the word "trader" in the search box.  

Now double-click Trader Rekt if that's what you want to do.    

To remove the Debug and Creative Menus, simply go back into the (F1) console and type those two commands again to disable them.

11. Interesting information about MO2 for 7DtD:  **It's a self-contained ModList!**

This means it shouldn't stop you from having a concurrent game of Darkness Falls, Rebirth, Vanilla, and Smörgåsbord by FNS.  

I would not use Vortex, or run Mods out of other not-self-contained packs because they will mess with other ModPacks.      

ModLauncher can also be self-contained so long as you set it up correctly.  

---

12. "Hey, does this Wabbajack MO2 thing bundle other people's mods without giving them the credit and Donation Points?!"

No, that would be unethical.  This system does _not_ bundle their work in a zip and pass it off as mine.  

From a credit and Donation Point aspect, it's no different than a user going and manually downloading each of these mods one-at-a-time on NexusMods.

The Wabbajack and MO2 applications connect the API to NexusMods, so it downloads each mod individually.

Mod Authors still get download credit, complete ownership of their mods, and Donations Points (if they opted in) every time a player installs the mods from this ModList.

Wabbajack and MO2 work in harmony to provide curators like me (FNS) the ability to create ModLists for users to efficiently download and run with.

It's like having a friend do the grocery shopping and cooking for you.  You just sit back and enjoy the meal.  
A ModPack curator (like FNS) provides the ModList. 
That's it.

---

13. "Does a Wabbajack/MO2 ModList require permission from the others mod authors?"

No, because again, as far as NexusMods sees it, it's no different than a user going and downloading each of the mods from the ModList independantly and stringing them together exactly as I did.
All the Wabbajack/MO2 applications do is make the process more efficient to use someone else's list.  It does **_not_** rebundle/repackage mods! 
Your boy Fin (FNS) goes to great length to ask for permission to use Requirements, and if an author demanded I remove their mods, I would honor the request.
But, that's never been an issue because we try to keep people happy.

---

14. "Is Wabbajack/MO2 complicated to use... do I have to use that black screen with the white letters thing?"

Nope, it's the easiest method to enjoy other people's ModLists.  No command-line-interface, just a simple GUI.

---

15. Is it difficult to make your own ModList for 7DtD?

That depends how IT-savvy you are. If you have slightly above boomer-tier IT skills, you too can create a Wabbajack list. 

The Wabbajack Wiki on how to Compile your own ModLists is great, but it requires you to read and follow directions.

Additionally, the Wabbajack Discord group is extrememly helpful in making ModLists.

Word of caution, they are very much old-school IT people and will shout at you to: #RTFM!

If you want to make one, hit me up on Discord, and I can show you some of the pitfalls not addressed in the wiki specifically for 7DtD.  

https://discord.gg/wabbajack

https://wiki.wabbajack.org/modlist_author_documentation/Compilation.html 
This is the process to create your own Wabbajack/MO2 ModList.  It now supports 7DtD.  Just ping me if you need help in making one.

16. How does MO2 determine Load Order for 7DtD in this ModList?

17. Do you make any edits to Mod Authors files, on your list?
    
Yes, but only under **_very specific_** situations:

A. I asked the author, and he/she gave me direct permission to do so for Smorgasbord.  WalkerSim is an example.
I felt the Zombie Population Density was too high.  I asked Zeh_Matt, and he allowed me to diseminate that change to Smorgasbord users.
LittleRedSonja also allowed me to reduce the rate in which some of her special zombies spawn.  

B. Manually adding VRoid Avatars to the main Vroid Mod folder structure, so players don't screw it up.
Not really an edit, just a convenience. VRoid was made to have Avatars and Dances added to it.
I just do it for users to make everyone's life easier.

C. Fixing Folder Structure, non-existent file name, or adding missing files to allow the mod to work correctly.
Some Mod authors leave a mod folder out, or double-nest folders. I fix this for Smorgasbord.

Exception... I have commented out something within someone's xml mod to allow it to function in the pack.
D. Patching a bug in their xml. 
Example: Tool Time ha) a bug where you decreased experience points when mining. 
We fixed it, and had it patched for our community prior to the Mod Author updating their mod.  


---

18. Does Smorgasbord work with 7DVR?

Yes, but you need to manually install 7DVR into the base game files, then configure the 7DtD game to launch MO2 from Steam.

Because this effects the main game's base files, I encourage any 7DVR users to make a second copy of the base game in a different location.
Launch 7DVR and or Smorgasbord+7DVR from the secondary location.

Recommendation: Go into the Properties of the MO2.exe and set the permissions to Always Run as Administrator.

I have not fully tested every mod for compatibility, but so far, so good.

Use the directory path for where you launch the MO2 for Smorgasbord from:

Edit your Launch Option in Steam similar to this:
```"D:\MO2 from Git\ModOrganizer.exe" "moshortcut://:7 Days to Die" %command%```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d07ddd3-bb8f-4f81-b83e-b87cee03bd5c)


I use a Meta Quest 3, with the Virtual Desktop Application, to launch Steam VR.

Within Steam VR, after launching 7DtD, I Alt+Tab over to MO2 to launch the game.  

It then places the 7DVR Loader into the Steam VR overlay.

---

19. "I'm a Mod Author, and I'd like you to consider adding my mod to Smorgasbord." or "Hey, can you add this super cool mod?!"

I follow all new/updated mods on NexusMods.  
If one somehow slipped my radar, hit me up on my channel at Guppy's Discord Server.  

I will consider all good mods.  

However, they must offer something unique, that is compatible with other mods on the list, and be available via NexusMods or Git. 
I can't use Google Drives, Mega, or other sites.  They won't work, increase problems, or have cybersecurity risks I won't expose myself/users to.

There are like 372 Stack Increaser and 973 Backpack mods.  I don't want to add more of those!
_At this very moment, someone is uploading another as you read this._

Give me something new, or fun, that fits the list's compatibility, and is available for Wabbajack to download and I will 100% add it.

20. "**Why aren't you on Reddit?  You'd get more people trying your list.**"

TL;DR version: Not my scene. I hate doxxing, hive-mind, and how agrieved they are about everything.

Blog Post version:

Sure, I'd like more people to play Smorgasbord, but I really don't like that platform. 

I've lurked there in the past, and seen people get doxxed for wrong-think for having a contrary opinion.  That, disgusts me.

Giving people like that a platform is like handing a loaded gun to a toddler.  

They have no civility, charity, nor nobility in what passes for their raisin souls.

When I see someone post something they worked hard on, like a mod, or a YouTube video, the crowd just pisses on it.

It takes courage for a new creator to put their works on display... 

They're joyless cretins who only derive satisfaction by crapping on the works of better men.

There are are some good users like Cinnaspice and Zer0Wulf, who have plugged Smorgasbord there, and I appreciate it, but the majority of people there are toxic in their negativity.


Have you spent anytime on the 7daystodie subreddit?  
At least 50% read like they were written by this guy:

It ultimately comes down to this: the majority of them are whiney sniveling emotional cripples, malding on the sidelines of life criticizing those of us who provide others with value.

21. "Why don't you add nude mods?"  or "Why not add DoubleG's Zombies now that it's available on NexusMods?"

I'm not a prude, and I hate censorship. I beleive in freedom of choice, speech, and association.

I like Double G's Zombies mod, I want to add it to the list, but I can't for one reason:

It contains a female cadaver zombie with an exposed nipple. 
I would say it's medically accurate, and grody, not prawn-o-graphic, but it still counts as nudity.


Smorgasbord cannot contain any mods that could potentially add any of the following labels: Nudity, Adult, NSFW.
Just having a Wabbajack ModList with these tags will reduce interest from new users.  

Three amplifying reasons:

A. Guppycur's Discord Server does not allow NSFW mods.
Adding Adult mods means most Discord Servers in the 7DtD community would not allow me to post links on their servers.


B. Some of my original community members are parents who play this game with their children.
They play with profanity disabled. They're okay with violence, or use the mod to disable gore. 
They would not be okay with nudity or the creepier furry mods.
I'm a family man myself and don't want to push my people away.


C. YouTubers and Streamers could potentially get a strike against their channels if using these mods.
I don't want that to happen to them, and refuse to take on that responsibility.
Don't beleive me? 
I was watching a live stream on YT of a guy playing a FNV Overhaul, he didn't realize it contained nude female raiders.
He got a strike against his channel and that video taken down.  


At the end of the day, it's so easy for you to add those mods into your own MO2 instance.
I'm not judging you, I play with mature mods in other games, but not here in Smorgasbord.

If you want to add it to your own game, there it is:
https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/8212

DoubleG did a great job with his zombies, and he is an entertaining YouTuber. 

Download and drag the zip into your MO2 "downloads" folder.
Then when you see it on the right of the MO2 application Downloads section, drag it over to the Mod List and enable it.
Put `[No Delete]` in front of the name of it so the next update of Smorgasbord will not delete the added mod.

22. "Hey FNS, could you make this ReadMe any longer?  I'm really looking for something beefy after finishing <ins>War and Peace</ins>."

It's long because it's comprehensive.  

For people who have been modding this game for years, they already know most of this stuff.  

The more self-service users are with troubleshooting their own problems, the less work and aggravation there is for me!  

Fin is not paid tech support.  Sorry, I just don't have the time. I do the best I can, but I am one man doing this as a hobby.

So far 2,200+ people have downloaded this list.  I am expecting another three to ten-thousand users in time. 

I had to take a break for three months because of user-induced burnout. I don't want to burn myself out.

It's always someone's first day, so I assume anyone reading this could be entering the world of game modding with an empty cup.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9394e729-c90e-448a-90f6-f5e1111a779b)

###"Fin, you're kind of an odd duck about this modding stuff?"

Well, maybe I am. You see, I'm the sort of person old enough to remember when PC Gaming required an above 8th grade literacy level.

Man, I miss those days.

**What it comes down to is this:**

Your boy Fin is passionate about modding. 

You'll see NPCs regurgitate platitudes like "he just needs to touch grass", but those people don't have souls. 

Modding is important to me. 
Yet, I am all for making the process more convenient for users. 
Wabbajack has made it the easiet it's ever been, but it still requires a sense of ownership. 

**If a user is unwillingly to read and follow the directions, _they do not deserve the deluxe modded experience_.**
