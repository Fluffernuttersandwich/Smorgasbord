2.5.2.4 11:00 EST 15JAN2026

Warning: I disabled Izy AIO and changed the EFTX Z2 ammo selection. 
Either reconfigure your mods, start a new game, or wait to update to begin a new play through.

Comments:

1. I disabled the IZY AIO and add-on mods to it because I got tired of the comments and complaints about the animation bug.  
I get it, but they're not going to be fixed until the next update to that mod, and I don't know when that is.  

2. I added a splashscreen image when MO2 opens. 

Mods Removed: 

EFTX Ammo and Attachment Compatibility mods... the new cursor hover features.
These mods need a bit more time in the oven.  
They'll be back.

Mods Updated:

"LitteRedSonja Zombie Pack"
"Descent" Fixed Dedicated Server issue.
"Efficient Base Repair"
"TraderSync"
"CATUI Backpack"
"Wasteland"


Mods Added:

N/A
