**Smörgåsbord ModList Update:** ```2.5.2.15 16:25 EST 07FEB2026

Warning: There's no guarantee you can update the mod list and continue to play in the same save. 
If you are happy with your current playthrough, don't update until you are ready to start a new game. 

Comments:

1. Regarding "7 Days Super Resolution", Laydor released an Add-on for Nvidia GPU users called "Unity Nvidia Modules".
You can choose to manually opt in to this yourself.
It's optional, and requires EAC to be disabled. So, if you play vanilla with EAC enabled sometimes, don't do this.
It requires you to manually drag the file into your 7DtD root directory to replace the vanilla files. 
These optional files are to help improve image quality and go into your game folder.
If the game updates versions, you will probably need to repeat this manual installation process. 
Reminder: Super Resolution is only for Windows, not Linux/Mac.
