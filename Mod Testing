Comments:

"What's that pumpkin outside of POIs?"
When you clear a POI, it places a lit jack-o-lantern pumpkin outside of it automatically to mark it as a cleared POI.
It prevents the POI from being offered by the traders as a quest again. 
It comes from the "POI Scourge"
It also awards you points to spend in a special trader option. 

Mods Removed: 

N/A

Mods Updated:

"CAS"
"EFTX Suite"
"Natural Progression"

Mods Added:

"LittleRedSonja and Mumpfy ArmorPack09 - Fallout" Armor, disabled.
This Armor Pack is Cosmetic Only. So you can look like the NCR Ranger if that's your jam.
This works in Wasteland, where I toggled it as enabled in that Profile.
However, in Wasteland, the Cosmetics will bleed through if you are wearing Power Armor.
So turn off the Cosmetics in the Wardrobe prior to gearing up in Power Armor.
LRS has been informed, and will look into it as time permits.  

"Drums of War" Quest, enabled.
Craft a Drum of War, place it and beat the Drum of War inside of an active quest POI (Clear/Infested). 
This will activate all Sleeper Volumes at once.
This was made to help you finish stuck Clears in POI Quests.
Warning! I would not recommend going into a tier 5, and activating the drum of war if you haven't cleared any volumes yet. 
Simultaneously spawning hundreds of zombies could cause your game to crash.
