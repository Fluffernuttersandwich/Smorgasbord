Mods Removed: 

"Ophidiophobia" The mod author keeps updating and breaking the folder format.
I'm tired of fixing the folder formatting every time he updates this mod.
If you want the mod, manually add it and fix the formatting yourself.

"Quartz"
"Goodby Stone Tools"
"KFC UL"
"Zweihander"
"Singularity" Thank you Byteblazar for supporting Linux users.
