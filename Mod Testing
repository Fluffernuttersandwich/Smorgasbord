"Less Grass"
"Less Tree" Performance, enabled.
Reducing trees and grass can boost performance slightly (5-10 FPS). Must toggle mod in a new world.

"Byteblazar's RWG Tweaks" Experimental, disabled.
Not your average RWG tweaks. Improve POI diversity, prevent duplicates, cap POI tiers by biome, etc. 
This mod can wreck your RWG process if you don't understand what you are doing. 
Please read the NexusMods page carefully before using.
Note from FNS: if using Modded POIs like those in Smorgasbord (above 100x100 size) with ByteBlazar's RWG Tweaks mod, set Wilderness POIs to Few when generating a world.
I successfully tested RWG Tweaks mod with: ISI Randomized Traders, ISI World Gen Tweaker, and PGz All Map Size Generation.
I have not tested this mod with CompoPack/CUBP, and wouldn't recommend the combination. 

"16k_Default_Map_252" POIs, enabled.
Another map for Smorgasbord, but jumbo-sized for you folks who play multiplayer, or just want a a massive world to explore in a long playthrough.
I've been thinking about settling in for a slower progression longer playthrough that forces me to use Vehicle Madness for a better vehicle.  
I used ByteBlazar's RWG Tweaks to create this Map.
The main takeaway is this: you will not see duplicate POIs within the same biome.
Yes, you will see duplicate POIs in different biomes.
