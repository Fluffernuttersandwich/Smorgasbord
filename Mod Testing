Weapons, enabled.
These are melee weapons and weapon animations from KF2. I would consider these tier 4 melee weapons. 
These mods rely on the same requirements as EFTX/Closer's Weapon Pack.

"Kill Feed" UI, disabled.
Kill feed that shows who killed who, what weapon they used, and headshots!

"Buy on Day One - Vehicle Parts and Mods" OP, disabled.
All (vanilla) vehicle parts available at the trader on day one.
