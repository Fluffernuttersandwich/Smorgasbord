2.5.2.3 11:00 EST 13JAN2026

Minor update:
I previously forgot to actually INCLUDE the Wasteland profile.
It's there now.

Mods with Status Updates:
I enabled and moved a few minor mods that were experimental after confirming they worked without error.
These mods tested fine in multiplayer for us, moving to QoL, enabled
TraderSync, StorageSynce, and Party Scout.

Notice: 
The EFTX cursor-hover mods for Ammo and Attachment Compatibility work in singleplayer, but are not yet fully functional in Multiplayer.
I could run them fine on my hosted game, but my son had a benign (silent) error. 
StallionsDen has already been informed. A fix will likely come in time.

Updated Mods:
CATUI
Zeebark's POI Pack
