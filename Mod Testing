2.5.2.1 16:30 EST 13JAN2026

WARNING! This is a major update, it requires you to start a new save and world. 
If you are content with your current playthrough, finish it prior to updating the list.

Comments:

1. EFTX received a major update with some awesome new features; notably, being able to cursor-hover over an EFTX gun to see compatible weapon mods.
You can also cursor-hover over EFTX ammo to see which guns it is compatible with.
These major QoL features were brought to us by the Asylum Overhaul Mod team. 
Big thanks to them. If you like Smorgasbord, they run many of the same mods in their overhaul pack.
The major difference is their focus on horror and new entities. 

2. I’ve added a Wasteland Profile inside of MO2 for Smörgåsbord.

I originally created this just to try it myself, but since I was already doing the work, I figured I’d share it with anyone who’s interested.
If you like this, let me know.

What Is Wasteland?
If you haven’t played it before, Wasteland is a major overhaul mod designed to make 7 Days to Die feel more like Fallout.
It makes significant changes to core game systems, progression, and the overall gameplay loop.

What to Expect
You begin with a blacked-out screen.
You must spend 21 attribute points before you can begin a new game.
After that, gameplay proceeds with familiar early-game 7DtD challenges.
The overhaul introduces a completely different perk progression system.
This is not a small tweak — it meaningfully alters how the game works.

Important Warnings!
Please read these carefully before using the Wasteland profile.

Warning #1 — Support Expectations
Do NOT ask bdubyah or the Wasteland Discord for help with issues related to:

Running Wasteland inside MO2/Smörgåsbord
Any hybrid setup involving this profile
Their expected response will be:
Remove all other mods and start a brand new game.
Or troubleshoot it yourself.
That’s fair on their end. This setup is outside their intended support scope.

Warning #2 — Experimental Profile
This Wasteland profile is experimental in MO2.
That said:
I have personally playtested the delivered profile
No errors appeared
No concerning warnings appeared
Several hours of gameplay were stable
Still, this is provided as-is.

Warning #3 — This Profile Is Fragile
This is the most important section.
The normal Smörgåsbord profile can tolerate a lot of mod toggling during a new game.
The Wasteland profile cannot.
Consider this MO2 profile to be extremely fragile.

Safe:
You can disable mods you don’t want, and the profile will usually continue to function (in a new game).

Unsafe:
Enabling additional mods is very likely to break things.
Mods touching any of the following are especially risky:
UI
Progression
Recipes
Traders
Loot
Armor
Weapons
Enabling even a single incompatible mod can introduce errors.

No Patch Support
To be very clear:
We will not be making compatibility patches
We will not be troubleshooting custom combinations
This is provided on a take it or leave it basis
If you enjoy experimenting and understand the risks — great.
If not, you should probably stick with the standard Smörgåsbord profile.

Final Notes about the Wasteland
This exists for players who:
Want to experience Wasteland
Prefer using MO2
Understand experimental setups
Are comfortable self-troubleshooting
If that’s you — have fun.
If not — totally fair, skip this profile.
If you want to complain about how it adds GB to the download for something you don't plan on using, don't waste your breath.
I added it since I was having fun watch Glock9 play it.

Back to Smorgasbord...

Play Fallout music in your game from a radio. 

"Jen Model Revival" QoL, enabled.
Brings the A19-V2.4 Jen back to 2.5+. 
For those of us who prefer her former appearance.

"Party Scout" Experimental, disabled.
Let's any player's map discovery show on all teammates maps. 
All players effect one another's map fog of war. 
I have not had an oppurtunity to test this. 

"LittleRedSonja Sonja's Vanity Vault" Decor, enabled.
Adds new custom hairs and face paints that you can choose directly in the character creation UI, so they can be used together with any armor.
She's just too good to this community. :P
