2.5.2.4 17:00 EST 16JAN2026

Warning: I disabled Izy AIO and changed the EFTX Z2 ammo selection. 
Either reconfigure your mods, start a new game, or wait to update to begin a new play through.

Comments:

1. I disabled the IZY AIO and add-on mods to it because I got tired of the comments and complaints about the animation bug.  
I get it, but they're not going to be fixed until the next update to that mod, and I don't know when that is.  

2. I added a splashscreen image when MO2 opens. 

3. TFP moved 2.5 Stable from b23 to b27. Smorgasbord is compatible with both. It made a minor fix to the Apiary (Bee Hive workstation). 

Mods Removed: 

1. "Better Foods" was having a conflict with Medical Conditions. Easier to remove Better Foods...

2. EFTX Ammo and Attachment Compatibility mods... the new cursor hover features.
These mods need a bit more time in the oven.  
They'll be back.
