Standard warning: There's no guarantee you can update the ModList and continue to play in an old save.  
If you are happy with your current playthrough, stay on that version until you are ready to start a new game!
There are no critical patches, or life-altering mods that absolutely cannot wait until your next playthrough.

Mods Added:

"Steel UI" UI, enabled.
My favorite UI. A new mod author created a temporary band-aid patch to get Steel UI to work in 2.5.
I only did very brief testing. If you encounter problems, please let me know ASAP. 
The 15-Slot toolbelt (and add-on patch) aren't working correctly. Stick with 10 or jump enable 20.

"Longer Lasting Buffs Remove Water Change Over Time" OP, disabled.
This is an add-on to "Longer Lasting Buffs - 10x", 
If using the main mod, you should strongly consider enabling this mod as well so you don't spend hours trying to replenish your hydration from drug side-effects.

"9k_map..."
Another Smorgasbord default map.
