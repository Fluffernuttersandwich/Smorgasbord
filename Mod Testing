2.5.2.1 16:30 EST 13JAN2026

WARNING! This is a major update, it requires you to start a new save and world. 
If you are content with your current playthrough, finish it prior to updating the list.

Comments:

1. EFTX received a major update with some awesome new features; notably, being able to cursor-hover over an EFTX gun to see compatible weapon mods.
You can also hover over EFTX ammo to see which guns it is compatible with.
These major QoL features were brought to us by the Asylum Overhaul Mod team. 

2. I added a Wasteland Profile inside of MO2. 
I wanted to try it, but wanted to do it in MO2.
Since I was already doing it for myself, I figured I'd share it with you guys.
If you like this, let me know.

If you haven't played it before, it's an Overhaul mod to make the game more like Fallout. This makes major changes to game systems.
You start with a blacked out screen. You must spend 21 attribute points prior to being able to begin a new game.
Then you go through typical new game challenges in a normal game of 7DtD. 
This overhaul adds a different perk progression system. 

Warning 1: Do not ask bdubyah, or the Wasteland Discord for any assistance troubleshooting an issue with using Wasteland inside of MO2 and Smorgasbord.
Their response will be to have you remove all other mods (and start a new game), or figure it out yourself.

Warning 2: The Wasteland Profile I made is experimental! 
I have playtested the delivered profile without issues. 
There were no Errors, nor concerning Warnings in the console in the few hours of game I playtested.

Warning 3: The normal Smorgasbord profile in MO2 can tolerate toggling a lot of mods in a new game.
This is not the case for the Wasteland profile.
Consider the Wasteland Profile in MO2 to be extremely fragile! 
You can safely disable any of the mods you don't want active in this profile, and it will work.
Conversely, enabling almost any one of the majority of disabled mods in this profile will likely break your game.
Any mod that touches UI, progression, recipes, traders, loot, armor, and weapons could potentially cause errors.
No, we will not be making patches!
Take it or leave it.
